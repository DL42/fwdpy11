Construction of population objects
============================================================================================================================================

Background reading:

* :ref:`data_types`

Beginning with version 0.1.4, you are able to construct population objects from pre-calculated containers of diploid,
gamete, and mutation objects.  Constructing population objects this way allows for some very powerful simulation
methods.  However, some care is required, and you should be familiar with the material in :ref:`data_types`, which
covers how populations are represented in memory.
